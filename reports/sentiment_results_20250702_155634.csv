"Hello and welcome to the Kaza Kosa weekly news. I'm David Taylor and in this week's episode, this crazy Merc concept previews all the cool technology for the coming years. The facelifted Kia Sarrento, all you need to know, plus South Africa's cheapest plug-in hybrid vehicle. Now, did you know that Kaza Kosa, we're not just a cool YouTube channel, we also have almost 75,000 vehicles for sale. Let's get into the episode. Now, this crazy looking orange thing. No, not me. The concept. This is the Mercedes AMG GTX. And yes, it's a concept which was based on another concept which was based on a 1970s experimental. The history of the Merc 1 is quite extensive. Look it up. But officially, there is actually a confirmation of a production model and the technology is quite insane. Now, quirky styling aside, and yes, there's going to be lots of you saying how ugly this car is, but this car exists to showcase the technological advancements in terms of electrical power trains, aerodynamics, and much, much more. Let me go through some of these nuggets. Three axial flux motors. Yes, these are the new generation motors. More than 1,000 kW, that's 1,300 horsepower for those of you who live in other parts of the world. And these new generation motors are smaller, lighter than a current electric motor. So that's pretty impressive. So smaller, lighter saves weight. In terms of aerodynamics, the drag coefficient is one of the lowest. And even the wheels have got active arrow. So they'll they'll open and close for cooling and to go top speed. But remember that aerodynamics is not just about efficiency. It's also like wind resistance. So it's all about the speed. And Mercedes AMG claims a top speed of more than 360 km/h. That's nuts. The battery tech has also improved. And while Merc hasn't given us all the details, they're saying 400 km of range in just 5 minutes of charging. That is quite impressive because one of the big arguments with EVs is people complain about the charging times and going, ""Well, I can always just fill up my diesel car in 10 minutes. Your electric car to do the same range takes 4 hours."" So, this is a big advancement. Now, my smart editor will cut to the interior, and you'll notice the steering wheel and some of the switch gear and the screens, they're lifted straight from the Mercedes AMG Project 1 hypercar, which is a good thing in my opinion. Now, I know, I know you're probably going, ""Oh, this is a waste of time. No one cares. This is just a concept. It looks ugly."" And so on and so on. But you need to see the bigger picture for this vehicle. Yes, it's a concept car, but the technology involved, we're going to see this in Mercedes products in the next couple of years. Onto the next story and what you see on your screens right now that is the facelifted Kia Sarrento and that's just launched in South Africa. It is a facelift of the fourth generation model and as you can see at the front there have been massive styling upgrades. The design has actually changed quite radically but if I look at the mechanical side of things the engine has been carried over and the 8-speed automatic gearbox that's been replaced by an 8-speed dual clutch transmission. Kia South Africa is offering the facelifted seven-seater Sarrento in a three model lineup priced from 99995 to just under 1.3 million which is quite the jump from the outgoing model which was priced from around 800k with the flagship being just under a million. The engine remains the same. It's a 2.2 L turbocharged diesel engine, 148 kW, 440 new meters and the flagship model, well the top two models have all-wheel drive which is great for gravel and inclement weather. Now, before you're all shouting, ""No one is going to pay 1.2 million for a Kia,"" I can hear you typing on your keyboards already. And yes, to a degree, it is a pricey proposition, but you need to take into consideration the current crop of German SUVs. Take your X3 from BMW, Audi, Q5, Merc GLC, those are in a similar price bracket. But when you consider like for like in terms of tech and features, many of those German cars offer those things as an option, pushing the price up considerably. Then you also need to consider the Sarrento comes out swinging with seven seats. It is a bigger SUV. Yes, the X3 GLC Q5 are from more prestigious brands, but there's no denying the Sarrento starts to make a good name for itself in terms of value for money. Would you? Finally, in our last story for the week, the race is on for South Africa's cheapest plug-in hybrid. And this time, this week, Cherry has come out swinging. We've only just published our assessments of the BYDC Line 6. You know that really cool plug-in hybrid SUV. And now Cherry has gone hold my rice wine. Watch this. This is the Cherry Tigo7 CSHPHEV. Now, how does it work? As a reminder, PHEV, that's plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Combines a petrol engine with a small electric motor and battery. And basically, you get the best of both worlds. In the case of the Cherry, 1.5 L turbo motor hooked up to an 18.3 kWh battery pack, 265 kW, 530 Newton meters, claimed fuel economy, 4.9 L per 100, and a total range of over 1,200 km. Like, that's really cool. But we'll take these figures with a pinch of salt. As always, we will test these figures when the vehicle eventually arrives. Now, if I go through the press release, there'll be two derivatives, plus and ultra. The basics are more than covered in the plus, but I think it's worth looking at the Ultra because that adds in nice things like a pano sunroof, automatic tailgate, heated ventilated seats, and a banging 8- speakeraker Sony sound system, which is really good. By the way, I've tried that in a few Cherry models. Pricing, and yes, as always, Chinese cars, absolute bargain on offer here. But there's a caveat. Interestingly, the price for the plus derivative sits at 599,900 rand, but it'll only cost that much until October. And then the price will go up to about 620 grand, which still to be honest I don't think is too bad. The higher spec model goes for around 680,000 rand for the additional content, but we'll put the warranty, service plan, and pricing on your screen now. And that brings me to the end of this week's video. As always, I will link additional reading and information on the vehicles you've seen here today. And remember, Cars Kosa, we're not just a cool YouTube channel. Well, this is this is a very cool YouTube channel. We also sell cars. We have over 75,000 vehicles on offer. Plus, we have all these really cool, helpful tools to make your car buying journey that much simpler and easier. I'll see you next week. Keep warm. Okay, bye. Let's find what moves you. cars.co.
